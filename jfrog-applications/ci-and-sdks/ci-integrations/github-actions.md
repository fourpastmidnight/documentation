# GitHub Actions

Setup JFrog CLI

This GitHub Action downloads, installs and configures JFrog CLI, so that it can be used as part of the workflow.

In addition, the Action includes the following features, when using JFrog CLI to work with JFrog Platform.

* The connection details of the JFrog platform used by JFrog CLI can be stored as secrets.
* There's no need to add the _build name_ and _build number_ options and arguments to commands which accept them. All build related operations will be automatically recorded with the _Workflow Name_ as build name and _Run Number_ as build number.

## Usage

### General

```yml
- uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v3
- run: jf --version
```

### Storing JFrog connection details as secrets

The connection details of the JFrog platform used by JFrog CLI can be stored as secrets. You can use one of the following two methods to define and store the JFrog Platform connection details as secrets.

1. [Storing the connection details using separate environment variables](broken-reference).
2. [Storing the connection details using single Config Token](broken-reference).

#### Storing the connection details using separate environment variables

You can set the connection details to your JFrog Platform by using one of the following environment variables combinations:

1. JF\_URL (no authentication)
2. JF\_URL + JF\_USER + JF\_PASSWORD (basic authentication)
3. JF\_URL + JF\_ACCESS\_TOKEN (authentication using a JFrog Access Token)

You can use these environment variables in your workflow as follows:

```yml
- uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v3
  env:
    # JFrog platform url (for example: https://acme.jfrog.io) 
    JF_URL: ${{ secrets.JF_URL }}
    
    # Basic authentication credentials
    JF_USER: ${{ secrets.JF_USER }}
    JF_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.JF_PASSWORD }}
    or
    # JFrog Platform access token
    JF_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JF_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
- run: |
    jf rt ping
```

| Important: If both Config Token(JF\_ENV\_\*) and separate environment variables(JF\_URL, ...) are provided, the default config will be the Config Token. To make the above separate environment variables as the default config use `jf c use setup-jfrog-cli-server` |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

#### Storing the connection details using single Config Token

1. Make sure JFrog CLI is installed on your local machine by running `jf -v`.
2. Configure the details of the JFrog platform by running `jf c add`.
3. Export the details of the JFrog platform you configured, using the server ID you chose. Do this by running `jf c export <SERVER ID>`.
4. Copy the generated Config Token to the clipboard and save it as a secret on GitHub.

To use the saved JFrog platform configuration in the workflow, all you need to do it to expose the secret to the workflow. The secret should be exposed as an environment variable with the _JF\_ENV\__ prefix. Here's how you do this:

```yml
- uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v3
  env:
    JF_ENV_1: ${{ secrets.JF_SECRET_ENV_1 }}
- run: |
    # Ping the server
    jf rt ping
```

As you can see in the example above, we created a secret named _JF\_SECRET\_ENV\_1_ and exposed it to the workflow as the _JF\_ENV\_1_ environment variable. That's it - the ping command will now ping the configured Artifactory server.

If you have multiple Config Tokens as secrets, you can use all of them in the workflow as follows:

```yml
- uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v3
  env:
    JF_ENV_1: ${{ secrets.JF_SECRET_ENV_1 }}
    JF_ENV_2: ${{ secrets.JF_SECRET_ENV_2 }}
- run: |
    # Set the JFrog configuration to use by providing the server ID (configured by the 'jf c add' command).
    jf c use local-1
    # Ping local-1 Artifactory server
    jf rt ping
    # Now use the second sever configuration exposed to the Action.
    jf c use local-2
    # Ping local-2 Artifactory server
    jf rt ping
```

| Important: When exposing more than one JFrog configuration to the Action, you should always add the `jf c use` command to specify the server to use. |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Setting the build name and build number when publishing build-info to Artifactory

The Action automatically sets the following environment variables: _JFROG\_CLI\_BUILD\_NAME_ and _JFROG\_CLI\_BUILD\_NUMBER_ with the workflow name and run number respectively. You therefore don't need to specify the build name and build number on any of the build related JFrog CLI commands.

In the following example, all downloaded files are registered as dependencies of the build and all uploaded files are registered as the build artifacts.

```yml
- run: |
    jf rt dl artifacts/
    jf rt u aether artifacts/
    jf rt bp
```

### Setting JFrog CLI version

By default, the JFrog CLI version set in [action.yml](https://github.com/jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli/blob/master/action.yml) is used. To set a specific version, add the _version_ input as follows:

```yml
- uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v3
  with:
    version: X.Y.Z
```

It is also possible to set the latest JFrog CLI version by adding the _version_ input as follows:

```yml
- uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v3
  with:
    version: latest
```

### Downloading JFrog CLI from Artifactory

If your agent has no Internet access, you can configure the workflow to download JFrog CLI from a [remote repository](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Remote+Repositories) in your JFrog Artifactory, which is configured to proxy the official download URL. When creating the remote repository, select the Generic package type for the repository.

Here's how you do this:

1. Create a remote repository in Artifactory. Name the repository jfrog-cli-remote and set its URL to https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/jfrog-cli/
2.  Set _download-repository_ input to jfrog-cli-remote:

    ```yml
    - uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v3
      env:
       # JFrog platform url (for example: https://acme.jfrog.io) 
        JF_URL: ${{ secrets.JF_URL }}

        # Basic authentication credentials
        JF_USER: ${{ secrets.JF_USER }}
        JF_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.JF_PASSWORD }}

        # JFrog platform access token (if JF_USER and JF_PASSWORD are not provided)
        # JF_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JF_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

        # Same can be achieved with a Config Token using JF_ENV_1 environment variable
        # JF_ENV_1: ${{ secrets.JF_SECRET_ENV_1 }}
      with:
        download-repository: jfrog-cli-remote
    ```

* See instructions for configuring the JFrog connection details under [Storing JFrog connection details as secrets](broken-reference).
